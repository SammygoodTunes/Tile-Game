\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Module name: tasks

This module defines all the client-side tasks when attempting to establish a connection to a server, or during an
established connection to a server.
These tasks check the authenticity of the client and any potential errors, as well as send various required packets
of game data, requests and responses. The packets are built using the different packet builders.

(See network/builders for the different packet builders.)
(See network/protocol for the different requests and responses.)
