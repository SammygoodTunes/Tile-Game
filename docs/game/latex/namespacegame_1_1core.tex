\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Core package.

This is the "heart" of the game. All game features and functionalities are call from here, as well
all the graphics rendered to the screen, are called from here.
It also is responsible for creating the game window, which is obviously a STRICT requirement in order to play. ;)
