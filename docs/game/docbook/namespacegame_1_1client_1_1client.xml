<title>Detailed Description</title>

<para><literallayout><computeroutput>Module name: client

This module handles all client-related things such as the camera, the player and the world.
It also initialises the connection handler to permit connections to servers.

Some of the attributes are linked with those in the managers, for instance
the player attribute is linked with the local player attribute of the player manager, in order for the
connection to have access to its properties.
This is because the communication between connection and connection handler modules is not bidirectional, so the
connection cannot directly recuperate the player attribute of the client module.
This could be implemented in a different way but for now this is how it works.

(See client/managers/ for the different client managers.)
