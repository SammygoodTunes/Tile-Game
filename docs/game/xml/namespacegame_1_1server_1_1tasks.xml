This module defines all the server-side tasks when a connection is being established with a client, or whilst a
client is connected.
These tasks check the authenticity of the client and any potential errors, as well as send various required packets
of game data, requests and responses. These packets are built using the different packet builders.

(See network/builders for the different packet builders.)
(See network/protocol for the different requests and responses.)
