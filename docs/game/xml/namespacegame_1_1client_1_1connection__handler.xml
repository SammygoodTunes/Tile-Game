<para><verbatim>Module name: connection_handler

This module acts as a pathway between the client and connection modules.
This means that whatever the connection module doesn&apos;t have access to, the connection handler will provide it with
what it needs. This is because most of the connection handling done by the connection module is run on a different
thread. And the way the modules are structure disallow for any direct communication between the client and connection
modules.
Shared attributes probably will (eventually) be implemented to make it thread-safe(r).
