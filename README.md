## Setup

> **<ins>Requires:</ins>** Python 3.11 or later
> 
> Before installing the necessary modules, it is recommended to set up a virtual environment. This allows for a clean workspace and avoids installing packages to your global environment.

Set up a new virtual environment. For the sake of conventions, we'll call ours `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv venv   # Windows
python3 -m venv venv  # MacOS / Unix	
```

Activate it using:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # MacOS / Unix
```

In order to install the necessary modules, Poetry is recommended but not required. You can install it using the following:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Install the pre-requisites:

```bash
poetry install
```

> If you prefer not to install the development dependencies, then feel free to use the ```--only main``` flag.
> 
> If you prefer not to use `poetry`, then you may manually install the dependencies listed [here](#dependencies) with pip.


Run the game using:

```bash
python -m game  # Windows
python3 -m game # MacOS / Unix
```

### Debug mode

If you wish to launch the game with extra debugging information, use the `--debug` or `-d` flag:

```bash
python -m game --debug   # Windows
python3 -m game --debug  # MacOS / Unix
```

> Note that using this mode will significantly impact the performance of the game, and therefore should not be used when playing normally.
